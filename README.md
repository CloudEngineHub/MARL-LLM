# MARL-LLM
To be completed

## Requirements
Only Ubuntu 20.04 is recommended.

## Installation
1. Create a new virtual environment using the following command:
```bash
   conda create -n xxx(your env name) python=3.10
```
2. Navigate to the 'marl_llm' folder and run the following command to install dependencies:
```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Visit the [PyTorch official website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/) and install the GPU version of PyTorch according to your system configuration, such as
```bash
   pip install torch==2.1.0 torchvision==0.16.0 torchaudio==2.1.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```
4. Navigate to the 'cus_gym' folder and run the following command to install the MARL-LLM environment:
```bash
   pip install -e .
```
5. If you encounter any other missing packages during the process, feel free to install them manually using ``pip install xxx``

6. The author is using VSCode, so it is recommended to add the following two paths to the bashrc file:
```bash
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:/home/your_project_path/marl_llm/"
```
7. Compile C++ shared library:
```bash
cd your_path/cus_gym/gym/envs/customized_envs/envs_cplus
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```
## Example
### training
1. Set the variable ``image_folder`` in ``cfg/formation_cfg.py``, for example, to ``'/home/your_path_to_fig/'``
2. Begin training:
```bash
cd your_path/marl_llm/train
python train_formation.py
```

### evaluation
Copy the name of the experimental directory you ran and replace â€µ`curr_run = '2025-01-19-15-58-03'`` in ``eval_formation.py``, then:
```bash
python eval_formation.py
```

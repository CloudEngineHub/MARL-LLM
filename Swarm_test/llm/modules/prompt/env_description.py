Consider a plane with a target area and a group of robots. The target area is discretized into a set of cells. 
Each robot is represented by a small disc, with a sensing radius and a collision radius. 
The robot can obtain the relative position and velocity of neighboring robots and the relative positions of the cells within its sensing radius. 
When the distance between two robots is less than twice the sensing radius, they are considered to have collided.
Additionally, when the distance between the center of a cell and the center of a robot is less than the robotâ€™s collision radius, that cell is considered to be occupied by the robot.
